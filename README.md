Swift Script Example

This repository demonstrates how to create and run a Swift script as part of Xcode’s Run Script Phase. 
The goal is to show how Swift scripts can be integrated into your Xcode project to automate tasks during the build process, 
such as code generation or project setup.

For a detailed guide, check out the related Medium (https://medium.com/@serhankhan/generating-swift-enums-from-json-strings-using-swift-scripts-in-xcode-968058dc9eb9) article.

This should now accurately reflect the purpose of the project. Let me know if you’d like any further changes!
